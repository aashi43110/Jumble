# Ignore environment files
/QA_Analyzer/.env

# Optional: Ignore specific variations if not covered by the wildcard
# .env
# .env.local
# .env.development
# .env.production

# Optional: If you have a template/example env file that *should* be committed
# you might explicitly un-ignore it (though it's often better to just
# not match it with the ignore pattern in the first place, e.g. name it differently)
# !.env.example
